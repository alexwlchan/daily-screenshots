# daily-screenshots

This is a script that takes a screenshot of the homepage of my website once a day.

## Why?

## How?

I have a GitHub Action that wakes up once a day and [takes a screenshot with Playwright](https://www.scrapingbee.com/webscraping-questions/playwright/how-to-take-screenshot-with-playwright/), which is a tool for automating browsers.
It saves that screenshot in this repo.

I filled in the historical archive with screenshots from the Wayback Machine.
